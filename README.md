## Welcome to my Concept Designs

This repository contains a collection of concept designs created using the Flutter framework. The designs are intended to showcase various UI elements and design patterns that can be implemented in a Flutter app.

### Getting Started

To view the designs, you will need to have the Flutter framework set up on your development machine. If you do not have Flutter installed, please follow the instructions on the [Flutter website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to get set up.

Once you have Flutter installed, you can clone this repository and run the following command in the root directory of the project:
